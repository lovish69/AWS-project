## AWS Account Setup

1. *Create an AWS Account*  
   - Visit [AWS Console](https://aws.amazon.com/) and sign up.
   - Provide billing details and complete verification.

2. *Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)*  
   - Go to *IAM > Users > Security Credentials*.
   - Click *Manage MFA* and set up a virtual MFA device (Google Authenticator).

3. *Create IAM Users and Roles*  
   - Create an IAM user with limited permissions for daily operations.
   - Assign necessary policies (AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess, AWSCloudTrailReadOnlyAccess, etc.).

4. *Set Up AWS Budgets*  
   - Navigate to *Billing > Budgets*.
   - Set a monthly budget and configure notifications for cost monitoring.

## Services Used  

1. *Amazon S3*  
   - Stores CloudTrail logs securely.  

2. *AWS CloudTrail*  
   - Records all API activity within AWS for security auditing.

3. *AWS Glue*  
   - Processes and catalogs log data.

4. *Amazon Athena*  
   - Queries logs from S3 using SQL.

5. *Amazon GuardDuty*  
   - Detects security threats and anomalies.

## Implementation Steps  

### 1. Setting Up Logging with CloudTrail  
- Go to *CloudTrail > Create a new trail*.
- Enable logging for *All AWS Regions*.
- Choose an *S3 bucket* for log storage.

### 2. Storing Logs in S3  
- Create an *S3 Bucket* (aws-security-logs).
- Set permissions for CloudTrail logs.
- Enable *Server-Side Encryption (SSE-S3)*.

### 3. Processing Data with AWS Glue  
- Create a *Crawler* in AWS Glue.
- Point it to the S3 bucket storing CloudTrail logs.
- Run the crawler to create a data catalog.

### 4. Querying Logs Using Athena  
- Open *Athena > Query Editor*.
- Create a database:  
  ```sql
  CREATE DATABASE security_logs;
  ```
